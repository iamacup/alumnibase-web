          <p>Whatever your role in the HE Sector, you’ve probably heard about the EU’s new regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It’s a new set of laws aimed at enhancing the protection of EU citizens’ personal data and increasing the obligations of organizations to deal with that data in transparent and secure ways. The GDPR applies not only to EU-based businesses, but also to any business that controls or processes data of EU citizens.</p>
          <p>At AlumniBase, our entire organization is hard at work ensuring that our own practices are GDPR-compliant. But equally important to us is helping you, our partners and customers, understand what the GDPR means for you and build compliant processes between us.</p>
          <p>A big piece of that is ensuring that the AlumniBase platform sets you up for GDPR compliance. Our basic product can be used without increasing your GDPR obligations, but to  maximise benefits it may be beneficial for us to share personally identifying information, and we each need to ensure we treat that data is required under the GDPR.
          </p>
          <p><strong>We are fully committed to enhancing the AlumniBase platform to enable easier compliance with the GDPR.</strong></p>
